		<h2>modeling consciousness</h2><br>
	<small>when I was very young, I had often wished that I had a microscope. this wish went unfulfilled for some reason. in september 2018, the bio lab at design academy eindhoven where I am currently doing my masters, got a microscope with a high definition camera attached to it. once I got my hands on it, a hundred ideas that had been lying buried in my subconscious started to coil up and reveal themselves in interesting forms.<br>
	<br>
	 I played with the microscope, looking at everything I could find: body fluids, food and soil are a few of these things. as these long evenings in the bio lab with my eyes glued to micro-world magnifications progressed, one idea stood apart from the many ideas that were rising from the dust of the mind: this was the idea that putting microscopic images of life along with images from larger scales such as human and planetary side by side: a micro-macro comparison, could be a way to explain complex metaphysical concepts that otherwise require long periods of study. I made the film <i>before my beginning</i> as a first experiment.<br>

	the phenomenal world that we experience follows an unwritten law of constant movement - everything that we perceive is always in motion, even though some of these things may at first appear to be at rest. we have been taught that a tree, which stands on solid ground with centred trunk and exploding leaf-structures does not move. but in itself, the tree is a hive of activity with visible growth and decay resulting from movement of the elements that make up the tree: radially outwardly extending trunk, flowing tree sap, roots that grow across the forest floor, and so on. thus it moves. even an inanimate object, such as a pen on a tabletop is not stationary: it moved before someone put it there and will move due to another cause. everything moves: things that do not seem to move in themselves, such as soil, or lifeless objects are also subject to movement by law of nature - the nonstop process of growth and decay touches everything in this world.<br>
	<br>then what is it that does not move? all entities in existence share a bipolar relation with an opposite - white has black, object has subject, the seen has the unseen: thus the unmoving must also exist. however this entity of non-movement stands distinct from the phenomenal world - it is of the noumenal. the isavsya upanishad in verses 4 and 5 explains the nature of supreme reality in terms of movement and non-movement:<br>
	<br>
	<i>‘the self is one. it is unmoving: yet faster than the mind. us moving faster, It is beyond the reach of the senses. ever steady, it outstrips all that run. by its mere presence, the cosmic energy is enabled to sustain the activities of living beings.’ </i><br>
	<br>
	<i>‘it moves; it moves not. it is far: it is very near. it is inside all this: it is verily outside all this.’ </i><br>
	<br>it can be said that the non-moving is the source of the moving. they correspond respectively to eternal immutability and unceasing change, as radhakrishnan* puts it. for more on this, watch the following clips:<br>

	<div><div grid-col="8" grid-pad="2" class=""><small>upon further research of the unmoved, I discovered a vast, unseen world that is beyond senses. the unmoving is one, it is eternal and is the source of all that is: itself, it illumines the five senses, and through these five senses its light reaches the phenomenal world, and thus creation is experienced. this unmoving element of reality, which is infact the only thing that is real in the truest sense, has slowly made its way into modern psychology. it can be termed consciousness. david chalmers**&nbsp; put forward this idea for psychologists to ponder in his paper <i>facing up to the problem of consciousness. </i><br>
	
	<br>how can I inspire in a viewer the idea of something that exists in the non-phenomal world? thus my process brought me full circle: to use a comparison of micro-macro footage in order to explain this all-encompassing model of consciousness. by showing to the viewer all that is phenomenally; all that moves and manifests, I hope to inspire him into knowing that which does not move and is not manifest externally. <br>
