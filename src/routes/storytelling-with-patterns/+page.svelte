	<small><h2>
	storytelling with patterns</h2><br>in the city of istanbul in turkey, there are several pockets of manufacture where craftsmen work in tandem with multiple low-scale production houses. sishane is such a suburb. here, in a small workshop, a family of craftsmen have been producing metal lampshades for generations. <br>
	<br>
	in this workshop, I found a lamp that was tucked away in a corner on a shelf. it was a collaboration between a glass-blower and metal craftsman fermi tarhan. <br>
	<br>
	this lampshade was special because it is an example of how modern industrial practices that only look for mass production options and final profit are washing away the small-scale production climate of Istanbul. this particular lampshade did not cater to an easily repeatable design, unlike the majority of the products that are produced in this workshop, and that is why it stays on a shelf for twenty years. I decided to tell the story of this lamp to highlight the loss that Istanbul would face if this current working culture is destroyed.

		<small><div class="text-content max-w-screen-sm">the story of the lampshade was to be told through a graphic pattern that revealed the journey that each component took across the world before it became a part of the final lamp. to compile my research data, I broke down the lamp into all its parts, from screws to washers to metal rods and went to all the workshops and retailers in the district of sishane and documented every step taken in the final assembly together of the lamp, which happened in my home.</div></small>
